## Setup
 Go to [setup.md]()

## Workers setup

1. use ``` npx wrangler generate <worker-name> ```
2. setup workers -> free plan
3. go to ``` https://dash.cloudflare.com/<accountID>/workers/overview ```
4. copy the **accountID** and paste that in the .toml file -> account_id
5. use ``` npx wrangler publish ```
6. go to ``` https://test-worker.priyatham-vatsavaye.workers.dev ``` to have a look

### Explanations

#### Cloudflare workers

**What are Cloudflare Workers?**
Cloudflare Workers is a serverless platform that allows developers to run JavaScript code directly on Cloudflare's edge network. This means that the code is executed on Cloudflare's servers, which are located in data centers all over the world, close to the users. This allows for faster performance and improved speed for web applications, as the code is executed closer to the user, reducing latency.

**Features**

- Modifying or manipulating the content of a web page before it is delivered to the user
- Routing and redirecting web requests
- Adding authentication and authorization to web applications
- Caching and optimizing web content
- Handling webhooks and other real-time events

**Advantages**

- Event-driven: Workers run in response to specific events, in this case, web requests
- Fully managed environment: Cloudflare takes care of the underlying infrastructure, making it easy to deploy and monitor code
- Built-in development environment: easy to write, test, and deploy code
- Improves performance, security and flexibility of web applications

**Conclusion**

Cloudflare Workers is a powerful tool that allows developers to run JavaScript code on Cloudflare's edge network, which can greatly improve the performance, security, and flexibility of web applications. It is easy to use, and has various features to handle different types of web requests, making it a great option for developers looking to improve the performance of their web applications.

**What is wrangler?**

Wrangler is a command-line tool provided by Cloudflare that helps developers manage their Cloudflare Workers projects. It allows developers to create, test, and deploy their code to the Cloudflare Workers platform.

Wrangler provides a number of features that make it easy to work with Cloudflare Workers, such as:

- Creating new projects with a single command
- Previewing changes locally before deploying to the edge network
- Deploying code to the edge network with a single command
- Managing environment variables
- Generating boilerplate code for common use cases
- Managing and publishing custom routes

Wrangler is built on top of the Cloudflare Workers API and is open source. It is available as a command-line tool that can be installed via npm and it supports multiple languages, including JavaScript, Rust, and Lua.

In summary, Wrangler is a command-line tool that helps developers to manage their Cloudflare Workers projects, it makes it easy to create, test and deploy workers, it also provides various features to manage environment variables, custom routes, generate boilerplate code and much more.

**What is Serverless?**

Serverless is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider is responsible for managing the servers and infrastructure required to run and scale an application. In this model, the developer is only responsible for writing and deploying their code, while the cloud provider handles the underlying infrastructure.

**Advantages**
- Cost-effective: Pay only for the resources used, without the need to maintain and scale servers.
- Scalability: The cloud provider handles the scaling of the application, allowing for automatic scaling based on demand.
- Flexibility: The ability to easily deploy and run code without the need for provisioning and managing servers.
- Focused on code: Developers can focus on writing and deploying code, without the need to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

**Key Characteristics**

- Event-driven: Applications are triggered by specific events, such as an HTTP request or a message in a queue.
- Stateless: Applications do not maintain any state, with all data being stored externally.
- Microservices-based architecture: Applications are broken down into small, independent, loosely coupled services.
Conclusion

Serverless is a cloud computing execution model that allows developers to focus on writing and deploying code, while the cloud provider handles the underlying infrastructure. It provides cost-effective, scalable, flexible, and focused on code solutions. This model is well suited for event-driven, stateless, and microservices-based architecture applications.
