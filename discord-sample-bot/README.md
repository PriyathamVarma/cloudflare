# What is discord?

Discord is a voice and text chat platform designed for online gaming communities, but also used by many other groups and communities. It allows users to communicate with each other via text, voice, and video, and also includes features like servers, channels, and user roles. Discord can be accessed via a web browser or through a dedicated mobile or desktop app.

## What is discord.js?

Discord.js is a JavaScript library for interacting with the Discord API. It allows developers to easily create bots and automate interactions with the Discord platform, such as sending messages, managing roles, and more. With Discord.js, developers can create powerful and custom experiences for their Discord communities, such as:

- Automated responses: Respond to certain messages or keywords automatically, without the need for human intervention.
- Moderation tools: Use Discord.js to create bots that can help moderate servers, such as kicking or banning users, clearing chat, and more.
- Music bots: Create bots that can play music in a voice channel, with the ability to queue songs, skip tracks, and more.
- Custom commands: Create custom commands for your bot that can display information, run calculations, or even generate memes.

Discord.js is built on top of the Node.js runtime, and requires knowledge of JavaScript to use effectively. It is a popular choice for creating Discord bots due to its ease of use and wide range of features.

## Main classes in discord.js

> Client: The Client class is the main class in Discord.js, and is used to interact with the Discord API. It allows developers to login to their bot, send and receive messages, and perform other actions on the Discord platform. This class provides methods for connecting to the Discord servers, event handling, and allows you to interact with the Discord API.

> Message: The Message class represents a message sent on a Discord channel. It has properties such as the content of the message, the author, and the timestamp, and also provides methods for replying to or editing the message.

> Guild: The Guild class represents a Discord server. It contains information such as the server's name, the channels and members, and also provides methods for managing the server, such as creating channels and roles.

> TextChannel: The TextChannel class represents a text channel on a Discord server. It provides methods for sending messages, deleting messages and checking permission on channels

> Collection: The Collection class is a powerful data structure that allows developers to store and manipulate data in a convenient way. It works like an array but with some additional functionality such as filtering, sorting, and mapping. It is used extensively by Discord.js, and is used to store things such as messages, guilds, and roles.

## What are client intents?

### Client Intents in Discord.js

In Discord.js, "client intents" are a way for developers to specify which events and data they want their bot to have access to. These intents allow the bot to receive and process certain events, such as messages or guild members, while ignoring others, which can help reduce the amount of unnecessary data the bot has to process.

There are several different intents available in Discord.js, including:

- **GUILDS**: Allows the bot to receive events related to guilds, such as joining or leaving a server, or updating the server's name or icon.
- **GUILD_MEMBERS**: Allows the bot to receive events related to guild members, such as joining or leaving a server, or updating their nickname or roles.
- **GUILD_BANS**: Allows the bot to receive events related to guild bans, such as adding or removing a user from a server's ban list.
- **GUILD_EMOJIS**: Allows the bot to receive events related to guild emojis, such as adding or removing an emoji from a server.
- **GUILD_INTEGRATIONS**: Allows the bot to receive events related to guild integrations, such as adding or removing a service like Twitch or Spotify from a server.
- **GUILD_WEBHOOKS**: Allows the bot to receive events related to webhooks in a guild
- **DIRECT_MESSAGES**: Allows the bot to receive events related to direct messages, such as receiving or sending direct messages
- **DIRECT_MESSAGE_TYPING**: Allows the bot to receive events related to direct message typing

You can specify which intents you want your bot to use by passing them as an options to the `Client` constructor or by using `client.setIntents()` method.

## Partials in Discord.js

In Discord.js, "partials" are a way to represent incomplete or missing data from the Discord API. When an event is triggered, the Discord API sends a payload of data to the bot, but sometimes that data may be missing or incomplete. For example, when a message is deleted, the API sends an event with the ID of the deleted message, but the message's content and author are not included.

Partials allow the Discord.js library to create "partial" objects, which represent these missing or incomplete pieces of data. These partial objects can then be "fetched" to retrieve the missing data. There are several different types of partials in Discord.js, including:

- **`Message`**: Represent a deleted or missing message.
- **`User`**: Represent a missing user or member.
- **`Guild`**: Represent a missing guild or server.
- **`Emoji`**: Represent a missing emoji
- **`Webhook`**: Represent a missing webhook
- **`Integration`**: Represent a missing integration

Partials can be used to improve performance and to avoid rate limits, by not fetching data that is not needed.
